        <h1>Meet Django</h1>
        <p>
          Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid
          development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced
          developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so
          you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the
          wheel. It’s free and open source.

            <h4>Ridiculously fast.</h4>
            <p>
              Django was designed to help developers take aplications from
              concnept to completion as quickly as possible.

            <h4>Reassuringly secure.</h4>
            <p>
              Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many
              common security mistakes.

          <p>
            DjangoCon Europe 2024 will be held June 5th-9th in Vigo, Spain but
            we're already looking ahead to the 2025 conference. Could your town
            - or your football stadium, circus tent, private island or city hall
            - host this wonderful community event?

            to Django</a
          >
          <p>
            Previously, individual membership required contribution of
            intellectual property (e.g. code or documentation); we’ve changed it
            so that individual membership now recognizes broader contributions
            to the DSF’s mission. That still includes code and docs, but now
            also includes many more activities: organizing a Django event,
            serving on a Working Group, maintaining a third-party app,
            moderating Django community spaces, and much more.
